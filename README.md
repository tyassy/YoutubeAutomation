# Hello,

Welcome to Tyas's Youtube Homepage web automation. In this page I am going to share how to run the test cases in this repository.

## To Be Prepared

- Google Chrome (for reference: I mainly run the test case using Version 117.0.5938.92).
- IDE Application (for reference: I am using IntelliJ IDEA 2022.1.2). After installing Intellij, there are still some things to be installed in plugins for a better testing experience.
  - Cucumber + 
  - Cucumber for Java
  - Gherkin
- Stable internet connection, as all test cases will access web browser.

## How To Test 

After Cucumber + and Cucumber for Java are installed, test cases can be tested from feature file by following the steps below:

- Clone the repository, one way to clone can try steps below:
  - Get from VCS
  - Paste URL
  - Click Clone
- Open YoutubeHome.feature
- Simply click play button on the left scenario name to run per case
- Or, simply click play button on the left of Feature: YoutubeHome to run all cases

If both Cucumber + and Cucumber for Java are unable to be installed for some reasons, test cases can be run also from CucumberRunner by following steps below:

- Open file CucumberRunner
- Input the desired test case tag in tags section
- Run CucumberRunner

After run the test case, test report can be seen in Run tab Intellij, and it is also available html format that can be accessed by clicking the link with prefix reports.cucumber.io/reports link is available in bottom in Run tab after run test.
